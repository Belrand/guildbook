TODO:

chats - update the chats tab and mixin

roster - change the old roster tab into maybe a db viewer type thing, all character details held in the saved var type thing, helps with debug as well

stats - update to callbacks and finalise the layout

guild bank - add in game bank data (tbc onwards)

calendar - 1 day way off in the future (maybe) convert this beast into an xml/templated/mixin/callback setup (maybe) 

tradeskills - well this is going to be the big 1, completely rework this, maybe to use a itemLink instead of itemID ???? merge into a single mixin, remove local functions etc

avatars - condense the amount further, somehow?

guild selection - setup the guild selection option
