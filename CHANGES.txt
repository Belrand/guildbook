TODO:

chats - update the chats tab and mixin


roster - change the old roster tab into maybe a db viewer type thing, all character details held in the saved var type thing, helps with debug as well
->almost completed

stats - update to callbacks and finalise the layout

guild bank - add in game bank data (tbc onwards)
-> i think this idea is a no

calendar - 1 day way off in the future (maybe) convert this beast into an xml/templated/mixin/callback setup (maybe) 

tradeskills - well this is going to be the big 1, completely rework this, maybe to use a itemLink instead of itemID ???? merge into a single mixin, remove local functions etc

avatars - condense the amount further, somehow?

guild selection - setup the guild selection option
-> merged this into the newer guild viewer which replaces the old roster view



[2022-01-16]
moved template mixin lua code out of the Guildbook.lua file and into the template.lua file to correspond with the template xml file
moved the calendar sync functions into the calendar OnShow call to reduce load up lag and chat spam
changed the Tradeskills:LoadGuildMemberTradeskills function to longer accept a guid, instead now uses a profession name and a character table
updated/corrected some template names and their mixin names, something long overdue
added profession buttons to the guild viewer rows template
added a default icon texture to the GuildbookSmallHighlightButtonMixin
added new function the GuildbookSmallHighlightButtonMixin, can now set a tradeskill atlas directly
