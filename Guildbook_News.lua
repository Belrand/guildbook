|cff06B200Bug fixes|r:
Enchanting recipes should now be scanned
Minor UI tweaks and improvements

|cff0070DEUpdates|r:
Character profession data now saved. When you request profession data Guildbook will first check if you have any data on file, if not its sends a request otherwise it loads from file. This reduces the impact on server resources (chat systems).
As a result of this change there will be some issues between this version and the previous version, some compatability has been included while guild members update their addon.
You will still be able to request data from older versions, but this will not be stored locally. 
Older versions will not be able to receive profession data from you.

Profiles! You can view guild members details including gear, talents and professions through the new profiles UI.

New UI, professions have been merged into the new profiles area and make better use of the frame size.
The guild bank has been temporarily added to the profiles hub, *if* The Burning Crusade is released then this will be re-purposed as there is an in game guild bank.
Soft Res has been removed, there are far better addons for this purpose.

More features to be added soon, but need to level my hunter!

Calendar events can now have their titles and descriptions edited by the event owner.
The 'Push' and 'Request' buttons in the calendar have been added to help cover any times where events fail to sync (most likely due to a timing restriction).

Some translations have been added for the professions, more are needed!

I've been working on a new UI for guildbook, for a few reasons 1 of which is to avoid issues with other addons.

I'm still in the process of updating the code and moving things into the new UI, its mostly just the calendar to convert and update.

If you have the minimap button you can middle click on it to open the new UI (click with the mouse scroll wheel) or use this slash command

/run GuildbookUI:Show()

Any feedback on the new UI is greatly appreciated, curseforge comments are a good place for this or 1 of the wow addon discords.

Regards
