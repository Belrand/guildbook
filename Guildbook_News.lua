Welcome to Guildbook and thank you for using the addon.

|cff06B200Bug fixes|r:
Enchanting recipes should now be scanned
Minor UI tweaks and improvements

|cff0070DEUpdates|r:
Character profession data now saved. When you request profession data Guildbook will first check if you have any data on file, if not its sends a request otherwise it loads from file. This reduces the impact on server resources (chat systems).
As a result of this change there will be some issues between this version and the previous version, some compatability has been included while guild members update their addon.
You will still be able to request data from older versions, but this will not be stored locally. 
Older versions will not be able to receive profession data from you.
